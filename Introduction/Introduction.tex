\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

This project takes the perspective of a research and development team at Grundfos, with the task of creating a work cell for the production of a rotor, using a flexible workstation. The workstation can mounted with a manipulator, which can be programmed to perform various tasks in the work cell. The manipulator is meant for use in collaboration with human operators and employees, since it has a relatively low payload and speed, which reduces the risk of causing injury, making it safe enough for the employees to work in its vicinity. The workstation is designed based on a number of requirements set in the case description.\\
