\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

This project takes the perspective of a research and development team at Grundfos, with the task of creating a work cell for the production of a propeller, using a flexible workstation. The workstation is mounted with a UR5 (Universal Robot), which can be programmed to perform various tasks in the work cell. The UR5 is meant for use in collaboration with human operators and employees, since it has a relatively low payload and speed, which reduces the risk of causing injury, making it safe enough for the employees to work in its vicinity. The workstation is designed based on a number of requirements set in the case description.\\
