This project takes the perspective of a research and development team at Grundfos, with the task of creating a work-cell for the production of a rotor, using a flexible workstation. The workstation can be mounted with a manipulator, which can be programmed to perform various tasks within a work cell. The manipulator is meant for use in collaboration with human operators and employees.\\ 
A work-cell has to be designed based upon a number of requirements set in the case description.\\
