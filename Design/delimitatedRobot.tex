\section{UR}

Universal Robots was founded in 2005 by a group of Danish engineers. Their thought was, that every industrial robot on the market was designed to be big, heavy and expensive. Therefore the group decided to make a smaller and more agile kind of industrial robot.\cite{Urhist}\\


The UR is now being used to several different repetitive tasks by big and small companies.
Because UR robots are much smaller and do not have the same force as their bigger counterparts, they can be used in cooperation with humans, which is one of the biggest advantages. This allows the robots to be much more flexible and manageable.\\



These robots can work with humans, and are called collaborative robots/cobots.\\
Here are the specification for the UR5:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Weight: 18.4 kg.
    \item Payload: 5 kg.
    \item Footprint: 149 mm.
    \item Joints: +/-360 degrees on all the joints.
    \item Operating life: 35,000 Hours.
    \item Speed: joints = 180 degrees/sec, tool = 1 m/sec.
    \item Reach: 850 mm.
    \item Repeatability: +/- 0.1 mm.
\end{itemize}
The materials used on all the cobots are aluminum and plastic\cite{Ur5_about}\cite{UR5_tech}.






\chapter{Delimited requirements specifications}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A rotor cycle may not exceed 26 seconds within the work-cell
    \item The cycle of the rotor inside the work-cell must be ergonomic.
    \item The emergency stop must always be in reach of an operator.
    \item The UR5 must operate the rotor faster than a human.
    \item At least 4 points (Machines) in the work-cell must be within reach of the UR5.
    \item The UR5 must be able to lift a payload of 645g in 0 posistion.
    \item The UR5's programming must be flexible, so it wont lower the production time when a new machine is presented.
    \item The UR5 must react to the different tasks given to it by sensors.
\end{itemize}
