\section{Delimitations} \label{ch:Delimitations}

The requirements for the ideal robot is not what is available for the project. 
The work-cell that is given to the group by AAU, is not nearly big enough to cover the desired reach of the manipulator. As the case describes, see \ref{fig:workcellMR}, the reach of the manipulator has to be the same as 2 meters. The ideal work-cell can simply not be downsized to a shorter distance, without having to close the work-cell completely from entry.\\
To delimit the reach, a new solution had to be made, which is why the group decided to implement another manipulator on the opposite side of the Queue-table. This has to be delimited as well since the group do not have permission or knowledge to implement 2 UR5's on the same table.
For testing purposes, the work-cell can be simulated in a 2:1 scale, requiring half the space, and making the tests possible. \\
The required speed for the manipulator can in theory be done since the manipulator assigned to the group has a speed of 1m/s. The only delimitation is that, if the group want to get this speed, a default setting on the UR5 has to be overridden, so that it will be able to move at maximum velocity \cite{UserManual}.\\.
Looking at the sensors, the only available sensor for the group is in the UR5, which is the pressure sensor. This is a delimitation for the safety process of this project. However, the sensors can be simulated with another method, for example a command that can be implemented in the code of the UR5.\\

\section{Delimited requirement specifications}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The cycle time of the rotor may not exceed 26 seconds.
    \item The visual inspection of the rotor inside the work-cell must be ergonomic.
    \item The work-cell must comply with the ISO 10218-2 standards.
    \item All the pick and place points in the work-cell must be within reach of the UR5.
    \item The UR5 must be able to lift a weight of the rotor(645g) and the end-effector(UNKNOWN) at maximum reach.
    \item The UR5 must perform various tasks depending on which sensor or signal that is active.
    \item When a worker enters the work-cell the UR5 must slow its work pace, to reduce the risk of harmful behavior.
