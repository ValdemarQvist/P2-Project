\section{Testing}

In this phase of the project, a series of tests will be performed, in order to find out if the solution can fulfill the set requirements.\\ 

The UR5, which will be used for the test, will act as both of the robots from the solution in which 2 robots are used. In the first part of this test, the UR5 will take the rotor from the conveyor belt and place it into the balancing machine. It will then immediately move the rotor onto the visual inspection, and then onto the queue table. The time it takes for the UR5 to do this will be measured. The time spent in the machines will be added later. \\ 

In the second part of the test, the UR5 will act as the other robot in the work-cell. First it will move the rotor from the queue table into the leakage testing machine, then immediately on to the engraving machine, and then onto the output pallet. The time it takes for the UR5 to complete the second part will be timed as well. By adding the time measurements together, the total desired time it takes for the robots to move the rotor through the entire process can be calculated. \\
