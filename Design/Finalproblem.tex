\chapter{Final Problem formulation} \label{ch:finalprob}
 %How can the manipulator be set up to safely cooperate with humans within a work-cell, while the manipulator upholds the specified work-flow  time-limit of a rotor-cycle and the required specifications. 
 %How can the manipulator be set up to comply with the required specifications of not exceeding the 26 second cycle limit, while taking into consideration of the safety and ergonomic relations to the co-workers around it, in a flexible way to be able to accommodate changes to the work-cell.
 
 
 How is it possible for the UR5 to pick and place the rotors in the desired orientation and location of the work-cell, while upholding the cycle limit of 26 seconds and safety requirements of the work-cell?
