\chapter{Delimitations} \label{ch:Delimitations}

The requirements for the ideal robot is not what is available for the project. 
The work-cell that is given to the group by AAU, is not nearly big enough to cover the desired reach of the manipulator. As the case describes, see \ref{fig:workcellMR}, the reach of the manipulator has to be the same as 2 meters. The ideal work-cell can simply not be cut down to a shorter distance, without having to close the work-cell completely from entry.\\
Delimiting the reach, a new solution had to be made, which is why the group decided to implement another manipulator on each side of the pallet-table. This has to be delimited as well since the group doesn't have permission or knowledge to implement 2 UR5's on the same table.\\
The required speed for the manipulator can in theory be done since the manipulator assigned to the group has a speed of 1m/s. The only delimitation is that, if you want to get this speed, a default setting on the UR5 has to be overridden, so that it will move with maximum speed \cite{UserManual}.\\
Also the machinery have some time-consuming processes, hereby the threshold of 26 seconds might be exceeded.\\
Looking at the sensors, the only available sensor for the group is in the UR5, which is the pressure sensor. This is a delimitation for the safety process of this project. However the sensors can be simulated with another method, for example a command that can be implemented in the code of the UR5.\\
