\chapter{Safety at Grundfos}\label{ch:Safety at Grundfos}
In order to make sure that the risk of an accident is at a minimum at all times in the production line at Grundfos, a number of safety measures are installed, and certain precautions must be taken.\\

Every robot at Grundfos has an emergency stop button, which immediately shuts down the corresponding machine. The placement of these buttons have to be located so they are within reach, if an accident should happen, or preferably to avoid an accident before it happens. \\
It is required of such an emergency stop to immediately put to halt any ongoing motion, as well as if there are more than one robot in the same working space, then it has to be able to stop them all.\\
The UR5 robot has its emergency stop located on its control pad.\\

Additionally, most of the Robots at Grundfos must be inside a cage while running, and workers are in most cases prohibited from entering while the robots are running. The cages can be opened, for example to perform maintenance, while the robots are turned off.\\

However, some of the new additions to Grundfos are the UR5, which can be used without a cage. For this to be safe, the robots have a low maximum payload, and therefore are not as powerful as many of the other robots. But this also makes them much safer for workers to be around, since they are designed to be able to hit workers without injuring them. This is in addition to strict rules and training for the workers who operate, and work in collaboration with the robots. \\
