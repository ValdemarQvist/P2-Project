\subsection{A rail} 
A rail could also be another solution to extend the reach of the manipulator, by installing the manipulator on or under a rail so the manipulator can move back and fourth on a single axis or in a plane like a gantry crane. This solution will require two rails where one has to be installed on top of the other on a perpendicular axis\cite{FRUNS}.
