\subsection{Mobile platform}
A way to overcome the reach problem in the previous mentioned, could be a mobile platform where the manipulator will be placed on, so that the manipulator can be moved to reach any of the machines that the rotor has to go through to complete the work process. Usually having a mobile platform requires sensors which can give the platform a vision to move around within the work-cell\cite{doi:10.1177/1729881417718588}, furthermore it usually would require that the platform is programmed by an expert, but in this article \cite{doi:10.1177/1729881417718588} they focus on making a more user friendly platform, so that the worker at the station can program and incorporate, the mobile platform to fit into a new work situation.\\
