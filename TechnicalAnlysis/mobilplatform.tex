\section{Mobile platform}
A way to overcome the reach problem in the previous mentioned, could be a mobile platform where the manipulator will be placed on, so that the manipulator can be moved to reach any of the machines that the rotor has to go though to complete the work process. Usually having a mobile platform requires sensor that can give the platform a vision to move about with in the work-cell\cite{doi:10.1177/1729881417718588}, furthermore it usually would require that the platform is programmed by a expert, but this in article \cite{doi:10.1177/1729881417718588} they focus on making a more user friendly platform, so that worker can at the station can program and in cooperate the mobile platform to fit in a new work situation.
