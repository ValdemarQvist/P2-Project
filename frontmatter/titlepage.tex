}{% the abstract
This report aims to look into what is necessary to implement a collaborative manipulator into a pick and place work-cell, and how it can be able to take a task which is complex and make it more flexible, to put less strain on the workers, and make the work-cell safer.\\
The team has mainly focused on the UR5 collaborative manipulator, and how to incorporate it into a work-cell, to analyze the kinematics of setting up the UR5.\\
%The main goal was to set up the UR5 in an industrial environment as close as possible to what is depicted in this report.
