\section{Ergonomic}
According to the Danish labor inspectorate, article 4.05.3 there is a need to consider ergonomic work positions, of the person who has to inspect the rotor.\\
If the person has to do measurements on the rotor, it needs to be in a position where the worker does not have their arms in a stressful position.\\
There is also a need to take into consideration, if it is possible to make the work area more dynamic i.e. some times standing or seated this will insure that the person how is inspecting will keep the body function working.\\
There is also the need to make sure the neck and shoulders is not put under stress by looking up or down at the object\cite{ATpostions}.
