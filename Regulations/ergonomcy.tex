\section{Ergonomic}
According to the Danish labor inspectorate, article 4.05.3 there is a need to consider ergonomic work positions, of the person how has to inspect the rotor.
If the person has to do measurements on the rotor, it needs to be in a position where there the worker does have to have there arms in a stressful position.
There is also a need to take consideration, if it is possible to make the the work area more dynamic i.e some times standing or sited this will insure that the person how is inspecting will keep the body function working.
There is also the need to make sure the the neck and shoulders is put under stress by locking up or down\cite{ATpostions}.
