\chapter{Initial problem statement}\label{ch:Initial problem statment}
How is it possible to give a robotic arm a set of problems to solve, while figuring out the
coordinate systems of the 3D-space and giving it a set of code to autonomously figure out the algorithm given to it.\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Which ISO standards and regulations does the UR require?
    \item How is it possible for the UR to collaborate safely with humans?
    \item Which social aspects would impact the employees when implementing the robot?
    \item How is it possible to optimize the UR to benefit the assembly industry?
    \item Which end-effector would be most suitable for this case?
    \item How can the robot localize itself and move within the robot cell?
\end{itemize}
