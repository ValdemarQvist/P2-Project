\section{Safety at Grundfos}\label{ch:Safety at Grundfos}
In order to make sure that the risk of an accident is at a minimum at all times in the production line at Grundfos, a number of safety measures are installed, and certain precautions must be taken.\\

Every robot at Grundfos has an emergency stop button, which immediately shuts down the corresponding machine. The placement of these buttons have to be located so they are within reach, if an accident should happen, or preferably to avoid an accident before it happens. \\
It is required of such an emergency stop to immediately put to halt any ongoing motion, as well as if there are more than one robot in the same working space, then it has to be able to stop them all.\\
The UR5 robot has its emergency stop located on its control pad.\\

Additionally, most of the Robots at Grundfos must be inside a cage while running, and workers are in most cases prohibited from entering while the robots are running. The cages can be opened, for example to perform maintenance, while the robots are turned off.\\

However, some of the new additions to Grundfos are the UR5, which can be used without a cage. For this to be safe, the robots have a low maximum payload, and therefore are not as powerful as many of the other robots. But this also makes them much safer for workers to be around, since they are designed to be able to hit workers without injuring them. This is in addition to strict rules and training for the workers who operate, and work in collaboration with the robots. \\

\section{Safety devices}
there are many different safety devices  on the market, here are some that can be used to keep the employee safe will working along side a robot.\\

\subsection{light curtain}
A light curtain works as an invisible barrier, that is made up of two poles where a beam of non-visual light, is send between the poles, so if a person brakes the light beam at any point it while transmits a signal\cite{ligthcurtain}.\\

\subsection{Lidar}
Lidar can also be used as a safety devices, some can be programmed to send a pulse at a certain distances, if some thing then gets closer, send a signal to the control box.\\ 

These devices can be used to send signals to the control boxes of the manipulator, so if a person enters the work-cell while the manipulator is in operation it will stop or slow down. This can insure that if the employee is hit by the manipulator, the force is in a tolerable level.\\

\section{Conclusion}

When operating a manipulator there is certain standards and regulations that is important.\\
This project has delimited the regulations to something that cover the manipulators working together with humans.\\
When focusing on the workplaces and collaboration with robots, workplace-risks and assessments must be analyzed. This is why the project has put focus on ergonomy and grundfos, to get data from the real industries, and how they handle the problem that will arise when working with artificial intelligence.\\
Taking all of the above into consideration, a workplace that is implemented with robots has to have certain safety rules and have a safe work-environment.
